* Xilinx Interface Quick Start
** Project Creation
   1. File -> New project.
   2. Configure for the target hardware.
** New Source File
   1. Right click in project explorer and select ~New Source~.
   2. Select VHDL Module.
   3. Define inputs and outputs.
   4. Write source code between ~begin~ and ~end~ sections of ~architecture~ section.
   5. Implement Design -> Synthesize -> Check Syntax to verify syntax correctness.
** Test Bench
   1. Create new source, and select VHDL Test Bench.
   2. Associate test bench with module it's intended to test.
   3. If no timings are being used, delete all sections that have to do with timing (there should be two).
   4. Write tests in about line 70, between ~begin~ and ~end process;~.
   5. Click Simulation above project hierarchy.
   6. Select test bench source file in project hierarchy. *Make sure to select the testbench file, not the source file nested under it.*
   7. Run Check Syntax.
   8. Run Simulate Behavioral Model.
*** Example testbench source
    #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
  A <= '0';
  B <= '0';
  C <= '0';
  wait for 10 ns;

  A <= '0';
  B <= '1';
  C <= '1';
  wait for 10 ns;
    #+END_SRC
* Code model
  A source file (component?) has three parts, that appear in this order:
  1. Library use: Specifies libraries to use, and which parts of those libraries to use.
  2. Entity Declaration: This represents the external interface to the design entity.
  3. Architecture Body: This represents the internal workings of the design entity.

  Example:
     #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
       -- VHDL code for AND-OR-INVERT gate

       -- These lines give the entity access to all names in package
       -- STD_LOGIC_1164 in the library IEEE.
       library IEEE; -- library clause
       use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.all; -- use clause

       -- Start of entity declaration
       entity AOI is -- AOI is the name of this entity. Entity names are arbitrary.
       port (
         A, B, C, D: in STD_LOGIC; -- Ports A, B, C, and D are inputs of type STD_LOGIC.
         F: out STD_LOGIC; -- Port F is an output of type STD_LOGIC.
       );
       end AOI;
       -- End of entity declaration

       -- Start of architecture body
       architecture V1 of AOI is -- Entities can have multiple architectures. The name
                                 -- of this one is V1. Architecture names are arbitrary.
       begin -- End of architecture declaration and beginning of architecture definition.
         F <= not ((A and B) or (C and D)); -- The logic of the architecture.
       end V1; -- End of architecture definition.
       -- End of architecture body
   #+END_SRC
** Libraries
   A library contains multiple names. Use of a library must be specified in a /Library Clause/ at the beginning of a source file. Use of names within the library must be specified in a /Use Clause/.
   #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
  -- These lines give the entity access to all names in package
  -- STD_LOGIC_1164 in the library IEEE.
  library IEEE; -- library clause
  use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.all; -- use clause
   #+END_SRC
*** Standard Logic Library
    ~IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL~ in library ~IEEE~.
** Entity
   An entity is basically an abstraction of a group of components. [[https://www.doulos.com/knowhow/vhdl_designers_guide/an_example_design_entity/][Here is a link to the resource I'm using.]] Every input and output port of an entity is a signal. An entity is broken up into two /design units/: the /Entity Declaration/, and the /Architecture Body/.
* Data Types
** Signal
   A signal is kind of like a variable, except it represents an input/output element of a circuit. All input and output ports of an entity are signals. Example:
   #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
  A <= B or C; -- A, B, and C are all signals.
   #+END_SRC
** Bit vectors
   A bit vector is basically just an array of bits. They can be used with gates just like regular bits. 
*** Example
    The circuit on the right is equivalent to all four of the circuits on the left combined: \\
    [[file:Bit-vector.png]]
    
    Source:
    #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
  C(3) <= A(3) and B(3);
  C(2) <= A(2) and B(2);
  C(1) <= A(1) and B(1);
  C(0) <= A(0) and B(0);
    #+END_SRC
    This is equivalent to:
    #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
  C <= A and B;
    #+END_SRC
    
* Operators
** Logical
   The available logical operators are NOT, AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.
** Assignment
   - "<=": Assign a value to a signal.
   - ":=": Assign a value to a variable or a constant.
** Arithmetic
   These operators are in library ~numeric_std~, as well as either ~std_logic_arith~, ~numeric_std_unsigned~, ~std_logic_unsigned~, or ~std_logic_signed~.
   - ~+~: Addition.
   - ~-~: Subtraction.
   - ~*~: Multiplication.
   - ~/~: Division.
** Comparison
   - ~=~: Equal to.
   - ~/=~: Not equal to.
   - ~<~: Less than.
   - ~>~: Greater than.
   - ~<=~: Less than or equal to.
   - ~>=~: Greater than or equal to.
** Shift operators
   - ~SLL~: Shift left logical.
   - ~SRL~: Shift right logical.
   - ~SLA~: Shift left arithmetic.
   - ~SRA~: Shift right arithmetic.
   - ~ROL~: Rotate left.
   - ~ROR~: Rotate right.
** Concatentation
   ~&~. This is used for grouping objects and values. Example:
   #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
  x <= "00011";
  y := x & "001"; -- Can this be assigned to a bit vector?
  -- now y is equivalent to "00011001".
   #+END_SRC
   
* Timing
** Delay
   Delay is specified using the ~after~ keyword. The signals on the right hand side of the statement are constantly being monitored for change. When one changes, the statement is re-evaluated immediately, then the variable or signal on the left hand side is changed accordingly /after the amount of time specified on the right-hand side/. If an input to a statement is changed before that time has elapsed, output will not be affected by the new value of the input.
** Inertial vs. Transport Delay
   Let's say all input signals start with a value of 1. A changes to 0 at 15ns, then to 1 at 30ns, then to 0 at 35ns.
   #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
 C <= A and B after 10 ns;
   #+END_SRC
   C will change to 1 at 10ns (because of the inital delay from 0ns), then to 0 at 25ns (in response to A changing at 15ns, taking into account the 10ns delay), but is stuck at 0 and doesn't respond to A's changes at 30ns and 35ns. This is because they occured within 10ns of each other. This problem can be fixed with the *transport* keyword, to specify use of the /transport/ delay model, rather than the /inertial/ delay model.
   #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
 C <= transport A and B after 10 ns;
   #+END_SRC
   Here, C changes to 1 at 10ns (because of the inital delay from 0ns), then to 0 at 25ns (in response to A changing at 15ns), then to 1 at 40ns, then to 0 at 45ns.
** Basic circuit example
   [[file:Circuit1.png]] \\
*** Dataflow description
    This describes the flow of data using signals.
**** Example: Without timings
     #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
  E <= D or (A and B);
     #+END_SRC
     This defines the output signal E as the result of the Boolean algebra statement ~D or (A and B)~.
**** Example: With timings
     #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
  C <= A and B after 5 ns;
  E <= C or D after 5 ns;
     #+END_SRC
     This is similar code to the other example, except that it also includes timing. So, if B is changed, the first line is re-evaluated, and after 5ns, the result assigned to C. Then, because there was a change in C, the second statement is re-evaluated, then after 5ns, assigned to E (total time since B changed is now 10ns). This helps simulate the timings that will occur on real hardware.
*** Structural description
    This is when you have to define the gates you're using, then describe how they're used.
**** Example
     #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
  Gate1: AND2 port map (A, B, C);
  Gate2: OR2 port map (C, D, E);
     #+END_SRC
**** Explanation
     Two gates are defined: Gate1, which is an AND gate with 2 inputs (hence AND2) and 1 output, and Gate2, which is an OR gate with 2 inputs (hence OR2) and one output. The first two signals listed in the parenthesis are the inputs, and the last is the output.
** Repeater clock example
   [[file:Clock.png]] \\
   This circuit inverts the signal every 10ns, creating a clock with a period of 20ns, which continues indefinitely.
*** Source
    The following source is correct:
    #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
  CLK <= not CLK after 10 ns;
    #+END_SRC
    However, the following source is incorrect and will cause a runtime error:
    #+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
  CLK <= not CLK;
    #+END_SRC
    This is because there is no delay time, so the value of CLK tries to switch every 0ns, and time will never advance to 1ns.
